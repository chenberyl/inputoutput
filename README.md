# Fake ID Generator

I'm creating a website for users to create their own novelty fake IDs. They can input all of the information they want on their cards such as name, address, birthday, height, etc. And then the information will be outputted onto an ID card that I will design, however, the end result is meant to be humorous and absurd. I'm hoping to allow the user to have some level of customization for their ID card so there will be more interaction.
